NOT YET WORKING. 

This model is a c++ implementation of an agent based, population level model of
US TB levels that also analyzes cost. To run, download the files, navigate to 
models/agentHillModel, run make, then run ./agentModel. To plot the results, 
run R < plotData.R --save --args true [deltaT], where [deltaT] is your timestep.
